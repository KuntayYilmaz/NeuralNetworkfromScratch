# Neural Network Implementation for Fashion MNIST just using Numpy and Python without using Deep Learning Frameworks

This repository contains a custom implementation of a neural network using NumPy for the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model features dense layers, activation functions, dropout for regularization and using Adam optimizer. 

## Introduction

This project implements a feedforward neural network to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items in 10 categories, with each image measuring 28x28 pixels.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow`
  
## After Training you can predict random images from test set with model
