## Introduction

This project implements a feedforward neural network to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items in 10 categories, with each image measuring 28x28 pixels.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow
